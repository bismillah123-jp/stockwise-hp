## 🎯 What Changed - Alur Data

### BEFORE (Snapshot-Based)
```
User Input → stock_entries (mutable)
                   ↓
         night_stock calculated (trigger)
                   ↓
         Dashboard reads stock_entries
```

### AFTER (Event-Sourcing) ✅
```
User Input → stock_events (immutable)
                   ↓
         Trigger cascade_recalc (automatic)
                   ↓
         stock_entries recalculated (from date to today)
                   ↓
         Dashboard reads stock_entries (fast)
                   ↓
         Audit via EventHistoryView
```

### 2. Cascade Recalculation
- ✅ Automatic trigger after event changes
- ✅ Recalculates from affected date to today

- ✅ Notes display
- ✅ Responsive table

### 5. Dashboard Integration

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Database Testing
- [ ] Run migrations: `supabase db push`
- [ ] Verify stock_events table exists
- [ ] Verify cascade_recalc_stock function exists
- [ ] Verify trigger is enabled
- [ ] Test basic INSERT into stock_events
- [ ] Verify stock_entries updated automatically
- [ ] Test retroactive correction (change past event)
- [ ] Verify cascade to future days

### UI Testing
- [ ] FAB menu shows "🆕 Transaksi Stok" with NEW badge
- [ ] UnifiedTransactionDialog opens correctly
- [ ] Event type dropdown works
- [ ] IMEI validation works (< 10 chars shows error)
- [ ] Duplicate IMEI detection works
- [ ] Cost price formatting works (auto-format to Rupiah)
- [ ] Submit creates event in stock_events
- [ ] EventHistoryView shows new event immediately
- [ ] Search by IMEI works
- [ ] Filter by event type works
- [ ] Mobile navigation includes Event tab
- [ ] Desktop navigation includes Riwayat Event tab

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Add masuk event for today
- [ ] Verify appears in EventHistoryView
- [ ] Verify stock_entries updated
- [ ] Verify dashboard totals correct
- [ ] Add laku event for same IMEI
- [ ] Verify stock reduced
- [ ] Add masuk event for yesterday (retroactive)
- [ ] Verify today's stock updated automatically
- [ ] Delete an old event
- [ ] Verify cascade recalculation works

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Migrations
```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase migration up

# Or push to hosted database
supabase db push
```

### 2. Verify Migrations
```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('stock_events', 'stock_entries');

-- Check functions
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname LIKE '%cascade%';

-- Check triggers
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trg_cascade_after_stock_event';
```

### 3. Build & Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Build production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
# (follow your normal deployment process)
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Access UnifiedTransactionDialog via FAB
- [ ] Create test event
- [ ] Check EventHistoryView
- [ ] Verify cascade works
- [ ] Check performance (should be < 1s for single event)

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

### stock_events (NEW)
```sql
id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY
created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ
date            DATE
imei            TEXT
location_id     UUID → stock_locations
phone_model_id  UUID → phone_models
event_type      TEXT ('masuk','laku','retur_in','retur_out',...)
qty             INTEGER (default 1)
notes           TEXT
created_by      UUID → auth.users
metadata        JSONB
```

### stock_entries (EXISTING - now materialized)
```sql
id              UUID PRIMARY KEY
date            DATE
location_id     UUID
phone_model_id  UUID
imei            TEXT
morning_stock   INTEGER  ← from previous day's night_stock
incoming        INTEGER  ← sum of 'masuk' events
sold            INTEGER  ← sum of 'laku' events
returns         INTEGER  ← sum of 'retur_in' events
adjustment      INTEGER  ← sum of transfers & corrections
night_stock     INTEGER  ← calculated result
-- ... other fields
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

### Current State (After Implementation)
- ✅ stock_events table ready
- ✅ Cascade functions ready
- ✅ UnifiedTransactionDialog ready
- ⚠️ Old dialogs still work (backward compatible)
- ⚠️ No data in stock_events yet (clean slate)

### Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for new deployments)**
- Use UnifiedTransactionDialog from now on
- Old data stays in stock_entries
- New transactions go to stock_events
- Both systems work in parallel

**Option 2: Full Migration (For production with existing data)**
```sql
-- Backfill historical events from stock_entries
-- See EVENT_SOURCING_IMPLEMENTATION.md for script
```

## 💡 Key Differences from Old System

| Aspect | OLD (Snapshot) | NEW (Event-Sourcing) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Data | stock_entries | stock_events |
| Mutability | Mutable (can edit) | Immutable (append-only) |
| Transaction Type | Numeric fields | Explicit enum |
| Retroactive Edit | Manual recalc needed | Auto-cascade |
| Audit Trail | Limited | Complete |
| Input Method | Separate dialogs | Unified dialog |
| Data Loss Risk | Higher | Lower |
| Complexity | Simple | Moderate |

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **No Bulk Operations Yet**
   - One IMEI at a time
   - Future: Add batch import

2. **No Event Editing**
   - Events are immutable
   - Must delete & re-create
   - Future: Add soft delete with history

3. **No User Attribution**
   - created_by field ready but not populated
   - Future: Add auth.uid() on insert

4. **No Real-time Notifications**
   - Changes visible after refresh
   - Future: Add Supabase Realtime

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Cascade is efficient (per-partition)
- ⚠️ Large date ranges (>1 year) may be slow
- 💡 Consider async job queue for big corrections
